# Basketball Scoreboard

This is a custom-built basketball scoreboard developed from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. While the project idea was inspired by Scrimba’s Frontend Developer Career Path, the entire design and codebase were independently created to practice building interactive web applications and managing game logic.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of this project. AI tools were utilized solely for documentation purposes, such as generating this README. I believe in building a strong foundation in programming while also learning how to effectively use AI tools as part of a modern developer workflow.

## ✨ Overview

This project showcases a functional basketball scoreboard that allows users to simulate a game's scoring. It includes:

- Buttons to add 1, 2, or 3 points to the home or guest team
- A display showing the current score for both teams
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Users can click buttons to increment the home or guest team's score by 1, 2, or 3 points.
- The scores are displayed and updated in real-time on the screen.
- The application uses basic JavaScript functions to handle score updates and DOM manipulation.

## 🛠️ Personalization

Although the initial concept was provided by Scrimba, the following customizations were implemented:

- Designed and styled the layout from scratch using CSS
- Implemented score tracking logic in JavaScript
- Ensured responsiveness across various screen sizes

## 🚧 Planned Updates

- Add a reset button to set scores back to zero
- Implement a timer to simulate game periods
- Enhance the user interface with improved styling and animations

## 🗂️ File Structure (basic)

- `index.html` – Main structure of the webpage
- `index.css` – Styling for layout and design
- `index.js` – JavaScript for handling score updates and user interactions
- `vite.config.js` – Configuration for Vite

## ⚙️ Getting Started
